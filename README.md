## Setup
In order to set up the game, please either clone this repository or copy all of the files to a local location. Then simply open index.html and the game will start.

## Background
This game is derived from a children's game called Concentration.

## Instructions

There is a grid of 16 symbols, in random locations.
The object is to try to guess the pairs of symbols in as few attempts as possible. Once all pairs have been
guessed, you win the game and it will show you how many moves, how long it took, and your rating, and give
you a chance to play again.
